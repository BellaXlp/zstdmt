This repository uses 2 different licenses:
- all files in the `lib` directory use a BSD 2-Clause license
- all other files use a GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file,
and with the presence of COPYING or LICENSE file.

This model emphasizes the fact that only files in the `lib` directory
are designed to be included into 3rd party projects.
